Unit* Testing
1. test each piece of the program independently,        so easy to locate cause of faluliare
2. report passes, fails, errors: know what happend
3. setup code for test (construct inputs... delete them after)
4. test suites

Want to do something standard -> try to find some packages/libaries

JUnit5

Very usefull: the lec notes, for this and both JSwing

    // BeforeEach: called before each @Test
Tests are ran in random order

Test with System.in
System.setIn
System.setOut
